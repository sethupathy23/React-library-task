            A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are
            accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library
            provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies)
            materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both.
            A library's collection can include printed materials and other
            physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette and
            well access to information, music or other content held on
            bibliographic databases.
            <br />A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for
            use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an
            institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private
            individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide
            the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding,
            selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting
            information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of
            information with a variety of resources.

            Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as
            common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public
            facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance:
            computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and
            services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library
            have different needs from those of a special library or academic
            library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where
            programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. Modern
            libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a
            building by providing material accessible by electronic means,
            including from home via the Internet.

            The services that libraries offer are variously described as library
            services, information services, or the combination "library and
            information services", although different institutions and sources
            define such terminology differently.

            <strong className="sub-heading">History: </strong>
            The history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize
            collections of documents.[2] The first libraries consisted of archives
            of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script
            discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal
            libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the
            5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical
            period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those
            of Constantinople and Alexandria.
            <br />
            The Fatimids (r. 909–1171) also possessed many great libraries within
            their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi’ describes their palace
            library, which probably contained the largest collection of literature
            on earth at the time, as a "wonder of the world". Throughout history,
            along with bloody massacres, the destruction of libraries has been
            critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every trace of the
            vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent example of this
            can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in 1256
            and the torching of their library, "the fame of which", boasts the
            conqueror Juwayni, "had spread throughout the world".[3]
